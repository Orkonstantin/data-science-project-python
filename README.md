# Data science project in python - Popular Movie Prediction
#### Data Sources :
- Crawling : himovies , IMDB Popularity Actors
- EDA : medium
### The research quastion:
-  Can we predict the IMDB score of a movie based on given data?
### The process consisted of several parts:
- Scraping Data , Data Cleaning , EDA and Machine Learning
#### In the scraping section we used the crawling method to take the relevant data and convert it all to a DataFrame from the himovies site.
#### We then performed the Data Cleaning process: duplication handling, missing values, outliners handling and column optimization
#### Afterwards in the EDA phase we presented the data graphically and drew conclusions from the data
#### In the Machine Learning we split the dataset to 80% train and 20% test and we checked 4 different algorithms in order to see which one gives us the best prediction
### In conclusion we found that random forest regression model brought us the best predictions with 88.75% success
